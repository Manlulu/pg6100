OpenShift whont allways play along if its the first time you visit the page in a long time. 
If you see only the Wildfly startpage, just try again a few times and my page will show.
After it starts the first time, it will go on as normal.

EJB testing container:
I really tried to make it work, like we did right after last lecture, but I only got exceptions.
I got error messages like: EJB6005 No EJB modules found
I rolled my code back to the way it was before I started trying.

Hopefully have some time and can try it, and can make it work.
